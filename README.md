I spent a lot of time making cyanotypes during COVID-19. Cyanotypes are photographic images made by coating a paper with an iron mixture and exposing it to UV light. The paper is then bathed in water and turns a rich blue as it oxidizes. Any opaque material left on the paper will appear as a white outline. 

The cyanotypes used in this project were made with leaves from an orange tree.
